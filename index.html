                <h2>Georgina Milne</h2>
								I am a PhD student currently based at Queen's University, Belfast supervised by <a href="http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofBiologicalSciences/People/DrACameron/" target="_blank">Dr. Alison Cameron</a>, <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/nicola-whitehouse" target="_blank">Dr. Nicki Whitehouse</a> and <a href="http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofBiologicalSciences/People/ProfessorPAProdohl/" target="_blank">Prof. Paulo Prodhöl</a>.

								My research is centred on environmental niche modelling  and ancestral niche reconstruction.  The ultimate goal of this work is to determine the climate preferences of species  going back millions of years into the past.  I'm using fossil beetles for my research – not only are they particulrly abundant in modern times, but they also have a pretty good <a href="http://blogs.qub.ac.uk/qubio/2015/02/27/a-quick-and-dirty-overview-of-quaternary-entomology/" target="_blank">fossil  record</a>.  
								<br><br>I read Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge; I graduated with a 2:1 in 2005, after which I completed a masters in Management at Queen’s University in Belfast.  I’m still preparing my papers and PhD thesis so I can’t link to those (yet), but my undergraduate thesis on bumblebee pigmentation preferences has been published  
								Before returning to the fold of biological sciences, I worked as a software developer in the private sector doing some data warehousing and analytics. I'm still interested in data visualisation, data management and data science.  I don’t have as much use for my data warehousing skills these days, but I regularly use R, Python and T-SQL for the majority of PhD research.  My other skills and research interests are outlined in my academic CV (which is likely to change as I keep renaming my thesis chapters!).
